Using Rails version: 5.1.7 with Ruby 2.5.5

______________________________________________________________________________

This is a simple rails blog app that I am creating as part of 'The Complete
Ruby on Rails Developer Course' by Mashrur Hossain and Rob Percival on Udemy.
My educational goals for this app are to learn the basic structure of a Rails
application (route, controller, view, model) as well as CRUD operations,
database associations, authentication, and bootstrap.
